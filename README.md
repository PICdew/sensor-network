# Blocks: pretty-easy IoT with PIC16F1

I have made IoT wagon with sensors and actuators
![blocks_with_raspi](./doc/toy1.png)

I made IoT experiment in a hotel room, on a business trip to Okinawa (2017/2/2)
![okinawa](./doc/okinawa.png)

Then I have just configured three of my small routers with Ansible(2017/2/4)
![openwrt_ansible](./doc/openwrt_ansible.png)

=> [playbook log](./ansible/20170204.md)

Next, I pursue harmony of UART and IP, since UART is a standard interface for things. Small routers are central to the harmony.

## Background and motivation

### IoT building blocks of sensors/actuators

GPIO, I2C, SPI and UART/USART are widely adopted by sensor/actuator components. However, IT guys are not familiar with those low-level interfaces. I have decided to develop a gateway that works as a bridge between those low-level interfaces and serial (UART/USB), so that I can realize IoT building blocks for very-easy IoT system integration. I use [Microchip PIC16F1 series 8bit MCU](www.microchip.com/design-centers/8-bit) to develop the gateway, since they are very cheap and small.

Last year I saw eight-years-old kids working on robot programming with [LEGO Mindstorms](https://www.lego.com/en-gb/mindstorms). It was a bit surprising. I also had a chance to see [Microduino mCookie](https://www.microduino.cc/). They give me a hint. I also refer to [GROVE](http://wiki.seeed.cc/Grove_Starter_Kit_Plus/),  [TINYDUINO](https://tinycircuits.com/collections/all) and [KOOV](https://www.koov.io/).

### White box switches

Although I have been very interested in "NOS for white box" such as [Cumulus Linux](https://cumulusnetworks.com/) since several years ago, I have never had a chance to touch it -- I am just a poor Sunday programmer. So I have been running [OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org/) on my cheap small routers at home... OpenWrt is a tiny-version of white box NOS. I recently came up with sort of "Software-Defined Networking for IoT" with the building blocks, OpenWrt and Ansible.

## IoT building blocks

IoT is Internet of Things. Sensors/actuators communicate with other sensors/actuators or with human being. IoT is not a new concept at all. IoT is about opening up vertically-integrated legacy systems with IP (internet Protocol), as once I worked on Telephony and witnessed that plain-old Telephony systems dissapeared.

Most of sensors/actuators require some sort of gateway to be able to speak IP. They call it IoT gateway.

I focus on opening up sensors/actuators in a LEGO-block manner. In this project, I develop "open" sensors/actuators following the architecture below:

```

<--- IoT low-level block ---->
sensor
actuator      MCU     Comm. module    IoT gateway
  +---+      +---+      +---+         +--------+
  |   |      |   |      |   |         | Win PC |           (         )
  |   |--*1--|   |--*2--|   |---USB---| RasPi  |----------(The internet)
  |   |      |   |      |   |         | OpenWrt|           (         )
  +---+      +---+      +---+         +--------+

*1 GPIO/I2C/SPI/UART
*2 UART
```
I mainly use Microchip PIC16F1 series 14 pins MCU to develop the blocks.

![toy2](./doc/toy2.png)

## USB/UART (i.e., serial) as universal interface for IoT blocks

All the blocks support USB/UART interface. I define two types of bridges to connect the blocks to the Internet.

I use [FTDI](http://www.ftdichip.com/)'s USB-UART bridge. Linux automatically load a driver for FTDI chip and recognizes it as "/dev/ttyUSB*" device. On the other hand, Windows PC automatically download the FTDI driver from the Internet (or you need to install it manually), then recognizes it as COM* device. In case of OpenWrt, you need to install the FTDI driver manually by using opkg package manager.

IoT blocks with FTDI's USB-UART bridge(*1):
```
                                   +-----+                      
[sensor block 1]-UART-[*1]---USB---|     |                    (        )
[sensor block 2]-UART-[*1]---USB---| USB |---[IoT gateway]---( Internet )
[actuator block 1]-UART-[*1]--USB--| hub |    such as RasPi   (        )
[actuator block 2]-UART-[*1]--USB--|     |    or OpenWrt
                                   +-----+
```

Note: In case of PIC16F1455/1459, USB-UART bridge is unnecessary.

IoT blocks with MQTT-UART(or "UART over IP"?) bridge:
```
                   MQTT-UART bridge
                      +-------+                      (        )
[sensor block 3]-UART-|Comm.  |---wireless access---( Internet )
                      |module |                      (      )            
                      +-------+
```

The communication module supports one of these: WiFi, LTE, 5G, Wi-SUN, LoRaWAN, Sigfox.

(*) Note: I have not decided if MQTT is the right way or not. I have also studying other possibilities: "UART over IP", "USB over IP" or "Firmata". For WiFI, I use ESP8266. This document is very interesting: http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/50002230B.pdf

## Communication modules

- [USB-UART bridge with 5V supply]
- [USB-UART bridge with 3.3V supply](./doc/STEP_DOWN.md)
- [ESP8266(ESP-WROOM-02)]
- [USB Micro B connector(for PIC16F1455/1459)](http://akizukidenshi.com/catalog/g/gK-06656/)

## Base board prototyping for IoT building blocks

#### Base board prototype #2

This prototype uses PIC16F1825. It costs around $3, much cheaper than A*duino, but it requires one hour for soldering components onto the universal board. I have made three boards so far (it means I spent three hours to make them).

![prototype2](./doc/prototype2.jpg)

- 51k ohm pull-up register sits between Vdd and MCLR pins
- The 5P pin socket is for PICkit3.
- The green jumper pin is to enable/disable the LED blinking.
- The tactile switch is a reset button: shorts MCLR pin to GND.

#### Schematic of the base board

The following is schematic of the base board prototype #2:

![pico](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1PItJDNvJnGcRv9vkCc_wwkTdFGRrPGMQLLfpC9JUxE8/pub?w=680&h=400)

|Jumper pin|on           |off         |
|----------|-------------|------------|
|J1        |Enable LED   |Disable LED |
|J2        |Tactile SW as reset button|Tactile SW as general purpose SW|

The blocks may use I2C for inter-block communications.  In that case, the master needs to hide all the details of low-level communications from the user.

![pico_i2c](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1LMcj8u0Y6h_CqZZ0nOh6kb68Wq6j4hkFFoqb6wR4EJw/pub?w=480&h=283)

I am also thinking of something like UART-hub instead of I2C.

## Firmware implementation

Note: I use [MPLAB Code Configurator (MCC)](http://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-code-configurator) to generate code for USART, I2C, PWM, Timer etc.

#### PIC16F1455

- [I2C-USB bridge]

#### PIC16F1825

- [5V: Just red LED & tactile switch (Omron B3J-1000 or small one)]
- [5V: Solenoid (SparkFun ROB11015)]
- [5V: Distance sensor block (HC-SR04)](./distance.X)
 - [pin assignment](./doc/distance_pin.png)
- [5V: Acceleration sensor block ï¼ˆKXR94-2050)](./acceleration.X)
 - [pin assignment](./doc/acceleration_pin.png)
- [5V: Speed sensor block (A1324LUA-T)](./rotation.X)
 - [pin assignment](./doc/rotation_pin.png)

#### PIC16F1829

- [3.3V: Orientation sensor block (HMC5883L and L3GD20)](./orientation.X)
 - [pin assignment](./doc/orientation_pin.png)
- [5V: Servo motor actuator block (TowerPro sg90)](./servomotor.X)
 - [pin assignment](./doc/servomotor_pin.png)

Note: calibrating HMC5883L is a little hard. I read the data sheet that shows how to calibrate it.

## Non-PIC blocks

- [USB video with OpenCV](./camera)
- [Text-to-Speech for Japanese]

## Sensor/actuator boards

I have made these [boards](./doc/BOARD.md) so far. They are connected to the base board.

## Plug&play protocol

[PLUG AND PLAY PROTOCOL](./doc/PROTOCOL.md)

## Networking with the blocks

I plan to develop "UART router" and "routing protocol over UART" supporting various networking topology.

For example, hub-and-spoke topo:
```             
                  +----+
[block]-- UART ---|    |
                  |PIC |--- USB ---[host]
[block]-- UART ---|    |
                  +----+
```

## Using the blocks with UNIX pipe

It is pretty easy!

Things are recognized as "tty devices" on UNIX/Linux or as "COM ports" on Windows.

Linux also supports "/dev/serial/by-id" that assigns an unique name to each thing.

- Reading data from a sensor and feeding it to other UNIX commands via a pipe:
```
$ cat /dev/serial/by-id/<device_id> | command 1 | command 2 ...
```

- Sending data to a sensor/actuator:
```
$ echo <command> > /dev/serial/by-id/<device_id>
```

See this [usage](./doc/USAGE.md) page.

## Using the blocks with OpenWrt

==> [OpenWrt](./openwrt)

I run OpenWrt on my router (Buffalo BHR-4GRV) that I bought in Akihabara, Tokyo. The router was really cheap and the price was around $30.

The router is also equipped with one USB port, thus my router works as IoT gateway for the blocks developed in this project.

![bhr-4grv](./doc/bhr-4grv.png)

So I don't need expensive IoT gateway products (Intel ATOM-based or ARM-based ones). I don't even want RasPi in most of cases.

OpenWrt is free OS for IoT gateways as well as for WiFi routers.

For example, I connect the acceleration sensor block to my router, then I think that it may work as a distributed earthquake sensing system.

![toy3](./doc/toy3.png)

![toy4](./doc/toy4.png)

![toy5](./doc/toy5.png)

I like playing the piano, and I think of developing Internet of Pianos (IoP) with MIDI and the router:
![toy6](./doc/toy6.png)

MIDI is also a control protocol for projection mapping. In the IoT world, [Firmata](https://github.com/firmata/protocol) is based on MIDI.

## Working with Juputer/IPython

I connected the acceleration sensor block to my laptop PC on which Node-RED was running. Then I performed actual measurement with the sensor on a bus. All the data was saved on MongoDB via Node-RED, and I dumped it on a file in CSV format.

- [Data](./jupyter/accelerometer.csv)
- [Jupyter notebook](./jupyter/bus.ipynb)

## Working with Node-RED

Node-RED is thought of as a good tool for rapid prototyping in IoT communities.

All the blocks just use USB as an interface to IoT gateway, so it is pretty easy to integrate these blocks with Node-RED.

I run Node-RED on my RasPi 3:

![node-red-1](./doc/node-red-1.png)

![node-red-2](./doc/node-red-2.png)

I am currently developing flows using the blocks: [node-red flows](./node-red).

Node-RED is not aware of underlying networking layers, ignoring IP subnets, VLANs, networking security etc. The tool is for IT guys, not for networking guys. We definitely need sort of "Node-RED for networking".

So I use Ansible for the time being for configuring network. But I also want some graphical and dynamic tool like Node-RED. In that sense, this tool is very interesting: [OpenNaEF](http://www.opennaef.io/).

## Ansible

==> [Ansible](./ansible)

I am going to use Ansible to manage the system:
- sensor/actuator blocks
- IoT gateways (RasPi/OpenWrt)
- Node-RED or other applications

I tried out Ansible in the past (three years ago). It was not a good tool, but it seems to me that a lot of improvements have been made since then. So I use Ansible this time.

## Internet of Hamsters (IoH)

If you want to learn IoT by doing, you had better have hamster. There are a lot of "things" you want to work on with IoT.

==> [HAMSTER.md](./doc/HAMSTER.md)

![hamster_wheel1](doc/hamster_wheel1.png)

I buy hamster not for animal experimentation.

## Future work

#### TTL serial JPEG camera

I want to develop a block supporting video with this TTL serial camera:
