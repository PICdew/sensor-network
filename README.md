# Building blocks for smart home and smart office with 8bit MCUs

![accelrerometer](./doc/A1324LUA-T-small.png)

## Background and motivation

It is very common that networking equipment supports CLI over a console port or SSH. I wonder if any home equipment or any office equipment supported CLI over serial interfaces at a minimal cost, so that any MCUs including 8bit ones can support it.

This project is to see what happens if home/office equipment supported such "cheap" CLI.

I assume that a networking gear such as a router works as a controller for the home/office. In that sense, I am becoming interested in Fog Computing.

I use Microchip PIC16F1 series 8bit MCU to develop prototypes in this project.

## UART (i.e., serial) as universal interface

Even low-end 8bit MCUs support UART, so UART is the most common communication interface of MCUs. You can add brdiges/tranceivers(USB/Ethernet/RS485/LIN...) to MCUs to extend the maximum cable length of UART.

All the blocks developed in this project support [Plug&Play protocol](./doc/PROTOCOL.md) that is "CLI over UART" as open APIs targeting home/office equipment.

I use [FTDI](http://www.ftdichip.com/)'s USB-UART bridges that support [VCP (Virtual COM Port)](http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm) so that Windows PC recognizes them as COM ports:

- Linux automatically load a driver for FTDI chip and recognizes it as "/dev/ttyUSB\*" device.
- Windows PC automatically download [the FTDI driver for Windows](http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm) from the Internet (or you need to install it manually) for the first time, then recognizes it as COM\* device.
- In case of OpenWrt, you need to install [the FTDI driver for OpenWrt](https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/port.serial) manually by using opkg package manager.

## Communication modules

- [USB-UART bridge with 5V supply]
- [USB-UART bridge with 3.3V supply](./doc/STEP_DOWN.md)
- [ESP8266(ESP-WROOM-02)]

## Base board prototyping for IoT building blocks

#### Base board prototype #2

This prototype uses PIC16F1825. It costs around $3, much cheaper than A\*duino, but it requires one hour for soldering components onto the universal board.

![prototype2](./doc/prototype2.jpg)

- 51k ohm pull-up register sits between Vdd and MCLR pins
- The 5P pin socket is for PICkit3.
- The green jumper pin is to enable/disable the LED blinking.
- The tactile switch is a reset button: shorts MCLR pin to GND.

#### Schematic of the base board

The following is schematic of the base board prototype #2:

## Firmware implementation

Note: I use [MPLAB Code Configurator (MCC)](http://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-code-configurator) to generate code for USART, I2C, PWM, Timer etc.

#### Usage

=> [USAGE](./doc/USAGE.md)

## Non-PIC blocks

- [USB video with OpenCV](./camera)
- [Text-to-Speech for Japanese]

## Plug&play protocol

- [Plug&play protocol specification](./doc/PROTOCOL.md)
- [Implementation](./pic16f1825/lib/protocol.X)

#### Including it as a library

- [Step1: include the protocol library directory](./doc/mcc_eusart4.png)
- [Step2: include the protocol library in your project](./doc/mcc_eusart3.png)
- [Step3: exclude mcc generated eusart libraries from your project](./doc/mcc_eusart2.png)
- [Step4: enable eusart interrupts](./doc/mcc_eusart.png)

## Use cases

#### Working with Python

=> [IoT gateway implementation](./agent)

#### Working with Juputer/IPython

I connected the acceleration sensor block to my laptop PC on which Node-RED was running. Then I performed actual measurement with the sensor on a bus. All the data was saved on MongoDB via Node-RED, and I dumped it on a file in CSV format.

- [Data](./jupyter/accelerometer.csv)
- [Jupyter notebook](./jupyter/bus.ipynb)

I noticed that Physics is in the heart of IoT:
- F = ma
- v = v0 + at

#### Working with Node-RED

It is pretty easy to integrate these blocks with Node-RED. I have run Node-RED on my RasPi 3 as well as on Windows PC:
- [node-red-1](./doc/node-red-1.png)
- [node-red-2](./doc/node-red-2.png)

#### Using the blocks with UNIX pipe

- Reading data from a sensor and feeding it to other UNIX commands via a pipe:
```
$ cat /dev/serial/by-id/<device_id> | command 1 | command 2 ...
```

- Sending data to a sensor/actuator:
```
$ echo <command> > /dev/serial/by-id/<device_id>
```

#### Using the blocks with OpenWrt

==> [OpenWrt](./openwrt)

I run OpenWrt on my router (Buffalo BHR-4GRV) that I bought in Akihabara, Tokyo. The router was really cheap and the price was around $30.

The router is also equipped with one USB port, thus my router works as IoT gateway for the blocks developed in this project.

![bhr-4grv](./doc/bhr-4grv.png)

OpenWrt is free OS for IoT gateways as well as for WiFi routers.

For example, I connect the acceleration sensor block to my router, then I think that it may work as a distributed earthquake sensing system.

#### Internet of Hamsters

See this [video](https://youtu.be/PpgvDuwcBxU) on YouTube.

I used [this small magnet for healthcare](http://www.elekiban.com/products/).

## Managing the system with Ansible

==> [Ansible](./ansible)

I have been using Ansible to manage the system:
- sensor/actuator blocks
- IoT gateways (RasPi/OpenWrt)

## IoT in the real world

#### Industry 4.0

There is a standard protocol ["IO-Link"](http://www.io-link.com/en/Technology/what_is_IO-Link.php?thisID=73) standardized by IEC. The goal of IO-Link is similar to my goal, except that my project targets RasPi and small routers/OpenWrt as a PLC-like controller for hobby-use sensor/actuator components.
