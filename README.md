# Mini PLC for smart home and smart office

This is a project to archive building blocks for mini PLC.

## Interfaces among building blocks

All the blocks developed in this project support [Plug&Play protocol](./doc/PROTOCOL.md):
- "CLI over UART"
- "CLI over UART" proxy for I2C backplane

#### "CLI over UART"

This construct targets a small router (or CPE) supporting PLC capabilities:

![arch](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/16cHL6QpvqUBJZJr4kIXCOJ5CkqHTnKV7QXeDOKtFB80/pub?w=640&h=480)

I use [FTDI](http://www.ftdichip.com/)'s USB-UART bridges that support [VCP (Virtual COM Port)](http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm) so that Windows PC recognizes them as COM ports:

- Linux automatically load a driver for FTDI chip and recognizes it as "/dev/ttyUSB\*" device.
- Windows PC automatically download [the FTDI driver for Windows](http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm) from the Internet (or you need to install it manually) for the first time, then recognizes it as COM\* device.
- In case of OpenWrt, you need to install [the FTDI driver for OpenWrt](https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/port.serial) manually by using opkg package manager.

#### "CLI over UART" proxy for I2C backplane

This construct is for [DIN housing for RasPi](https://www.phoenixcontact.com/online/portal/gb?1dmy&urile=wcm:path:/gben/web/offcontext/insite_landing_pages/efd3ca11-79cd-4971-a56c-3c20e29139ad/efd3ca11-79cd-4971-a56c-3c20e29139ad) and DIN rail.

## Base boards

#### PIC16F1825

The base board board described here is used as USB/UART devices.

![prototype2](./doc/prototype2.jpg)

- 51k ohm pull-up register sits between Vdd and MCLR pins
- The 5P pin socket is for PICkit3.
- The green jumper pin is to enable/disable the LED blinking.
- The tactile switch is a reset button: shorts MCLR pin to GND.

The following is schematic of the base board prototype #2:

![pico](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1PItJDNvJnGcRv9vkCc_wwkTdFGRrPGMQLLfpC9JUxE8/pub?w=680&h=400)

|Jumper pin|on           |off         |
|----------|-------------|------------|
|J1        |Enable LED   |Disable LED |
|J2        |Tactile SW as reset button|Tactile SW as general purpose SW|

The base board will also supports I2C bus network topology:

## Implementation

Note: I use [MPLAB Code Configurator (MCC)](http://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-code-configurator) to generate code for USART, I2C, PWM, Timer etc.

#### Plug&Play protocol

- [Plug&play protocol specification](./doc/PROTOCOL.md)
- [Implementation](./pic16f1825/lib/protocol.X)

Including it as a library:
- [Step1: include the protocol library directory](./doc/mcc_eusart4.png)
- [Step2: include the protocol library in your project](./doc/mcc_eusart3.png)
- [Step3: exclude mcc generated eusart libraries from your project](./doc/mcc_eusart2.png)
- [Step4: enable eusart interrupts](./doc/mcc_eusart.png)

#### UVC (USB Video Class)
- [USB video cam with OpenCV](./camera)

#### HID (Human Interface Devices)
- [Barcode scanner (OSOYOO 4209)]

## Use cases

#### Working with Python

=> [IoT gateway implementation](./agent)

#### Working with Juputer/IPython

I connected the acceleration sensor block to my laptop PC on which Node-RED was running. Then I performed actual measurement with the sensor on a bus. All the data was saved on MongoDB via Node-RED, and I dumped it on a file in CSV format.

- [Data](./jupyter/accelerometer.csv)
- [Jupyter notebook](./jupyter/bus.ipynb)

#### Working with Node-RED

It is pretty easy to integrate these blocks with Node-RED. I have run Node-RED on my RasPi 3 as well as on Windows PC:
- [node-red-1](./doc/node-red-1.png)
- [node-red-2](./doc/node-red-2.png)

#### Using the blocks with OpenWrt

==> [OpenWrt](./openwrt)

I run OpenWrt on my router (Buffalo BHR-4GRV) that I bought in Akihabara, Tokyo. The router was really cheap and the price was around $30.

The router is also equipped with one USB port, thus my router works as IoT gateway for the blocks developed in this project.

![bhr-4grv](./doc/bhr-4grv.png)

#### Internet of Hamsters

See this [video](https://youtu.be/PpgvDuwcBxU) on YouTube.

I used [this small magnet for healthcare](http://www.elekiban.com/products/).

## Managing the system with Ansible

==> [Ansible](./ansible)

I have been using Ansible to manage the system:
- sensor/actuator blocks
- IoT gateways (RasPi/OpenWrt)

## Security issues

JTAG and UART...

## IoT building blocks in the real world

#### DIN-rail housings

#### EnOcean modules

- [EnOcean modules for Japanese market](https://www.enocean.com/jp/enocean_modules_928mhz/)

#### Industry 4.0

There is a standard protocol ["IO-Link"](http://www.io-link.com/en/Technology/what_is_IO-Link.php?thisID=73) standardized by IEC. The goal of IO-Link is similar to my goal, except that my project targets RasPi and small routers/OpenWrt as a PLC-like controller for hobby-use sensor/actuator components.
